The modeling agency wanted take their models to the city and \n            help them get signed with even greater agencies in Time Square as \n            well as doing a bunch of photoshoots to establish connections with \n            the local artists. This trip inspired me to pick up photography. \n            I had a lot of experience in photo-manipulation throughout \n            highschool. Working with the models of Charlotte for a couple years\n            made me realize that there's not much money in this industry and it \n            lost its spark when I was having to really watch my money.
